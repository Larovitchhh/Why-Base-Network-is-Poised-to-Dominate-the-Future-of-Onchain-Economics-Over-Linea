4. Economic Model: Sustainable Growth Over Speculative HypeOnchain economics demands tokenomics that incentivize long-term value accrual. Base's fee-sharing with the Optimism Collective and potential network token (explored September 2025) prioritize Ethereum alignment, avoiding Linea's post-airdrop volatility.Revenue and Moats: Base generates $5 million monthly from MEV farming, lending, and stables—highest among L2s—while absorbing 83% of rollup fees to keep user costs low. Bridge fees are capped at $1, and wrappers like cbBTC expand liquidity.
Global Capital Markets Vision: Base aims for 25 million users and $100 billion in assets by end-2025, with 25+ local stables and worldwide ramps. This positions it for RWAs, payments, and tokenized assets, where Linea's institutional focus (e.g., bank pilots) is narrower.

Linea's dual-burn model (20% ETH fees, 80% LINEA) creates deflationary pressure, and its $LINEA token (72 billion supply, 85% for ecosystem) supports staking and governance. Price predictions hover at $0.018-0.023 by 2026, but competition from Arbitrum/Base dominance has capped its momentum.
