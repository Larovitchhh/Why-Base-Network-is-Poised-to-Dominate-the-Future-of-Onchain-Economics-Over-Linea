Why Base Network is Poised to Dominate the Future of Onchain Economics Over Linea
In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain scaling solutions, Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) networks are the battleground for the next wave of decentralized finance (DeFi), social applications, gaming, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. As of October 2025, two prominent contenders—Base, incubated by Coinbase, and Linea, developed by ConsenSys—stand out for their Ethereum-aligned architectures. Both promise low fees, high throughput, and seamless EVM compatibility, but Base is emerging as the more "futurible" (future-viable) platform for the burgeoning onchain economy. With superior user onboarding, explosive ecosystem growth, and a focus on consumer-grade scalability, Base isn't just competing—it's redefining how billions will interact with onchain value in the years ahead.This article explores the key reasons Base outshines Linea, drawing on recent network metrics, developer adoption trends, and strategic innovations. While Linea excels in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and institutional privacy features, Base's blend of accessibility, liquidity, and cultural momentum positions it as the go-to hub for a truly global, inclusive onchain future.
