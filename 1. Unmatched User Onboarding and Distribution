1. Unmatched User Onboarding and Distribution: Coinbase's Secret WeaponThe onchain economy thrives on accessibility—bringing in non-crypto natives without the friction of wallets, bridges, or high fees. Here, Base leverages Coinbase's 100+ million verified users as a built-in distribution engine, turning fiat-to-onchain conversions into a one-tap reality.Seamless Fiat Rails and Stablecoins: Base supports over 12 local currency stablecoins (e.g., EURC, BRZ for Brazilian Real, cNGN for Nigerian Naira), enabling users in emerging markets to bypass volatile local currencies and enter DeFi instantly. Coinbase's on/off-ramps are available in dozens of countries, with features like Verified Pools on Uniswap v4 offering KYC-compliant liquidity for institutions and retail alike. In February 2025 alone, Base processed $1.9 trillion in stablecoin transfers—43% of the global total—surpassing Ethereum, Tron, and Solana.
Hybrid Products for Mass Adoption: Innovations like Bitcoin-backed loans (up to $100K in USDC collateralized by cbBTC) and Coinbase One rewards (free gas and DeFi yield boosts) blend centralized trust with onchain utility. Over $65 million in BTC is already locked, powering $33 million in loans. This "home base advantage" funnels users directly into Base's ecosystem, where they can explore DeFi, NFTs, or payments without leaving the Coinbase app.

In contrast, Linea's integration with MetaMask (boasting 30+ million users) is strong for wallet-native experiences, but it lacks Coinbase's fiat depth. Linea's TVL hovers at $125-500 million with 317,000 daily active users, while Base boasts $3-7 billion TVL and 3+ million daily wallets. Linea's focus on zkEVM privacy appeals to banks (e.g., Swift's 2025 trials for tokenized settlements), but it doesn't match Base's consumer funnel for everyday onchain use.
