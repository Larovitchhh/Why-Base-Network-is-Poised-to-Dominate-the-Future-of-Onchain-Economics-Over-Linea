Conclusion: Base as the Onchain Economy's Ground FloorAs the onchain economy matures—fueled by AI agents, creator coins, and tokenized RWAs—networks like Base will win by prioritizing real utility over tech alone. Its Coinbase-backed distribution, dev-friendly culture, and scalable tech stack make it the ideal launchpad for apps that stick, from social micropayments to global stablecoin remittances. Linea remains a powerhouse for privacy-centric DeFi and TradFi bridges, but Base's consumer momentum and $7.9 billion in net inflows signal it's building the infrastructure for Ethereum's "next billion users."For builders and investors eyeing 2026 and beyond, Base isn't a bet—it's the default. Bridge in, ship fast, and watch the flywheel spin. The future of onchain value isn't just viable on Base; it's inevitable.
